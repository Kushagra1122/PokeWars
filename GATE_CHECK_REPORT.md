---

## Section 6: Client Settlement Flow

### Files Audited
- `client/src/pages/Game.jsx`
- `client/web3/services/MatchEscrowService.js`

### Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL (Needs Contract ABI)

**Current Implementation:**

✅ **Client fetches typed data from server**
- Lines 96-99 in `Game.jsx`: GET from `/api/matches/:matchId/typed-data`

✅ **Signs EIP-712**
- Lines 111-118: Signs with signer.signTypedData

✅ **Shows settlement status**
- Lines 28-30: State for status and tx hash
- Lines 237-246: "Awaiting opponent signature" message

⚠️ **Missing: Actual contract call**
- Currently submits to server endpoint (lines 123-133)
- Server does NOT call contract yet
- Need to add contract submission in server after signature verification

✅ **Service uses single source of truth**
- Line 4 in `MatchEscrowService.js`: Reads from env variable
- No hard-coded addresses

⚠️ **ABI file missing**
- `web3/services/MatchEscrow.json` not found
- Will be created during deployment
- Deploy script (lines 24-27 in `deploy.js`) exports ABI

**Action Required:**
1. Deploy contract to Base Sepolia
2. ABI will be automatically generated
3. Test end-to-end settlement flow

---

## Section 7: Escrow Lifecycle UI Sync

### Files Audited
- `client/src/components/Waiting/GameSettings.jsx`
- `server/models/Match.js`

### Status: ✅ PASS

**Verification Results:**

✅ **Match model stores all required fields**
- Lines 3-80 in `Match.js`: Complete schema
  - matchId (bytes32 hex)
  - playerA, playerB (refs)
  - stakeWei (string for large numbers)
  - txCreate, txJoin, txSettle (lines 33-41)
  - signatures sigA, sigB (lines 60-65)
  - serverNonce (line 66)
  - timestamps (lines 70-79)
  - Unique index on matchId (line 85)

✅ **UI waits for confirmation before start**
- Lines 28-75 in `GameSettings.jsx`: Escrow creation flow
- Lines 56-68: Waits for transaction confirmation
- Line 68: Only calls `onStartGame()` after success

⚠️ **UI does not show per-player "Escrowed" badge yet**
- Current implementation starts game immediately after tx
- Recommended: Add event listeners for deposit confirmations
- Recommended: Display tx hashes with badge in UI

**Minor Enhancement Needed:**
- Add visual confirmation of deposits in lobby
- Show shortened tx hashes next to player names
- This is non-blocking for gate check

## Three Transaction Hashes (To Be Completed)

After deployment and end-to-end testing, record here:

1. **createMatch TX:** `0x_________________________` (Player A deposit)
2. **joinMatch TX:** `0x_________________________` (Player B deposit)
3. **submitResult TX:** `0x_________________________` (Settlement)

**Instructions:** Follow `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` to complete end-to-end test and capture these hashes.

---

## Remaining Limitations (Deferred to Prompt 3)

The following features are intentionally **not implemented** in this phase:

1. **Points Anchoring Onchain**
   - `setPoints()` function exists but not called
   - Server does not write points to contract
   - Will be implemented in Prompt 3

2. **Event Indexing**
   - No event listeners for real-time contract events
   - No subgraph or indexer integration
   - Manual tx hash tracking for now

3. **Advanced Dispute Resolution**
   - Simple signature-based settlement only
   - No arbitration or challenge period
   - No partial refunds on disputes

4. **Gas Optimization**
   - No gas estimation in UI
   - No batching of operations
   - No meta-transactions

5. **Multi-Network Support**
   - Base Sepolia only (testnet)
   - Base mainnet integration pending
   - No L1/L2 bridge support

6. **Token Economy**
   - ETH-only escrow
   - No ERC-20 token support
   - No NFT integration
