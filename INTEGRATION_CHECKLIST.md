---

## ✅ Data Consistency Checks

### After Each Transaction
- [ ] Database updated correctly
- [ ] Blockchain transaction visible on Etherscan
- [ ] TransactionHash stored in database
- [ ] User balance updated
- [ ] Both users see consistent data
- [ ] Seller received correct amount (98% after fee)
- [ ] Platform received 2% fee

### Cross-System Validation
- [ ] Frontend balance matches blockchain + database
- [ ] Listings visible to other players
- [ ] User can't buy own listings
- [ ] User can't buy same Pokémon twice
- [ ] Price matches across all systems

---

## ✅ Error Handling

### Handled Scenarios
- [ ] User rejects transaction in MetaMask
- [ ] Network timeout during API call
- [ ] Invalid transaction hash
- [ ] Insufficient balance
- [ ] Transaction fails on blockchain
- [ ] Database update fails after blockchain success
- [ ] User disconnects wallet

### Error Messages
- [ ] Clear, user-friendly errors
- [ ] Consistent across frontend/backend
- [ ] Retry options when appropriate
- [ ] Logged for debugging

---

## ✅ Performance & Optimization

## 📞 Troubleshooting Guide

### "Contract not found" Error
```
Solution:
1. Verify contract address in .env files
2. Check contract deployed to Base Sepolia
3. Verify RPC endpoint is correct
```

### "Transaction verification failed"
```
Solution:
1. Check transaction hash format (starts with 0x)
2. Verify transaction on Etherscan
3. Check transaction was to correct contract
```

### Inconsistent balance
```
Solution:
1. Refresh page to reload from backend
2. Backend will re-verify blockchain state
3. Check transaction status on Etherscan
```

### Listing doesn't appear for other users
```
Solution:
1. Wait for blockchain confirmation (5-10 seconds)
2. Refresh page
3. Check database has listing record
4. Verify seller != viewer (own listings filtered)
```
